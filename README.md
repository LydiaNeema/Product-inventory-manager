  Add and delete product categories (stored in `localStorage`)

- **🏭 Warehouse Section**  
  Assign warehouse zones based on category logic

- **📊 Stock Overview Section**  
  Visual overview and log of stock movements, including low-stock alerts

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend/API Simulation:** JSON Server (`http://localhost:3000/Products`)
- **Icons:** Google Material Icons
- **Storage:** `localStorage` (for login session and categories)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pim-manager.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder
